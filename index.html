                  In this application, I have created a virtual version of the
                  popular game Rock, Paper, Scissors. It provides an interactive
                  experience where you can select one of the three choices:
                  Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer then randomly selects
                  its choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To enhance the gameplay, I have included additional features
                  such as an auto play option, which allows the computer to make
                  the selection for you. This adds an element of surprise and
                  convenience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moreover, the game keeps track of the score for you, providing
                  an enjoyable competitive aspect. The score is also saved to
                  your local storage, ensuring that your progress is preserved
                  even if you close the application. If you wish to start fresh,
                  you have the option to reset the score at any time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, this application offers a fun and convenient way to
                  play Rock, Paper, Scissors virtually, with added features for
                  an enhanced user experience.
