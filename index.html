                  I grew up on a family farm, surrounded by nature and hard
                  work. As a child, I actively participated in our farm's
                  operations, helping out at farmers' markets and engaging with
                  customers. These experiences cultivated my strong
                  communication skills and taught me the value of interpersonal
                  connections.

                  Driven by a desire to serve and make a difference, I pursued a
                  career in firefighting. I dedicated myself to the rigorous
                  training required to become a firefighter and obtained
                  certification as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT). This
                  allowed me to provide vital medical assistance to those in
                  need, further deepening my commitment to helping others during
                  challenging times.

                  Seeking new opportunities, I transitioned into the field of
                  electronics assembly. With a keen interest in precision and
                  craftsmanship, I specialized in magnetics and gained expertise
                  in building transformers for the defense industry. This role
                  demanded meticulous attention to detail and a thorough
                  understanding of complex electrical systems. It provided me
                  with a unique perspective on the intersection of technology
                  and national security.

                    In this application, I have created a virtual version of the
                    popular game Rock, Paper, Scissors. It provides an
                    interactive experience where you can select one of the three
                    choices: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer then
                    randomly selects its choice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To enhance the gameplay, I have included additional features
                    such as an auto play option, which allows the computer to
                    make the selection for you. This adds an element of surprise
                    and convenience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, the game keeps track of the score for you,
                    providing an enjoyable competitive aspect. The score is also
                    saved to your local storage, ensuring that your progress is
                    preserved even if you close the application. If you wish to
                    start fresh, you have the option to reset the score at any
                    time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, this application offers a fun and convenient way to
                    play Rock, Paper, Scissors virtually, with added features
                    for an enhanced user experience.
